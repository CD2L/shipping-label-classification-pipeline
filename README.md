# Shipping Label Classification Pipeline

This project aims to use deep learning algorithms to detect whether a product is counterfeit by analyzing images of boxes and their labels. This repository is a PoC Demo of how the pipeline actually works using web scraped images.

You can download all pre-trained models via the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cJOny4WFzIUuGLXxJlAnG0BSijZW-NMn/view).

## Dependencies
The pipeline requires a number of packages to run. You can install them in a virtual environment on your machine via the command :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd ./yolov5
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
cd ..
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## Getting started
After cloning this repository, you can now run this command:
```shell
streamlit run ./demo.py
```

Once the service is up,  you can interact with its UI: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
